This repository contains a [fpm font package](https://fpm.dev/featured/fonts/) containing [Google Font: 
Arya](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arya/about).

## How To Use This Font In Your FPM Package:


Include fifthtry.github.io/roboto package into `FPM.ftd` file:

```ftd
-- fpm.dependency: fifthtry.github.io/roboto
```

Inside your `FPM/config.ftd` use the font:

```ftd
-- fpm.type.headline-small.font: $inter.fonts.Roboto
```

Now if in any file you do:

```ftd
-- ftd.text:
role: $fpm.type.headline-small
```

You will see the `roboto` font.

## About Original Project

Arya is a Devanagari and Latin type family. It originated with Modular InfoTech's 1201, and was made more smooth. The new and original Latin design is intended to match the Devanagari in weight and and size with an unusual high-contrast sans serif design.

This project is led by Eduardo Tunni, a type designed based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. To contribute, visit [github.com/etunni/Arya](https://github.com/etunni/Arya)
