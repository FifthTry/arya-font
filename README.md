## About Original Project

Arya is a Devanagari and Latin type family. It originated with Modular InfoTech's 1201, and was made more smooth. The 
new and original Latin design is intended to match the Devanagari in weight and and size with an unusual high-contrast 
sans serif design.

Designers: Eduardo Tunni, Principal design
